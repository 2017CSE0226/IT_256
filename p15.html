	<p>History

CricBuzz was created by Pankaj Chhaparwal and Pravin Hegde in 2004. In 2010, CricBuzz started developing a mobile app for live cricket news and scores.

In November 2014, Times Internet, a subsidiary of Times of India acquired a majority stake in CricBuzz for an undisclosed sum. The website continues to be managed by the original founders.[5][6]

In January 2015, Times Internet-owned GoCricket was merged into Cricbuzz. GoCricket's website was redirected to Cricbuzz and the GoCricket mobile app was also merged with that of CricBuzz.[6]
